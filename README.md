## Snps and Me
[Single nucleotide polymorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism), or SNP in short, identifies a single location in your genome, and it is used by 23andme to store your information. This is very handy, because there are several large databases which can provide information on the SNP‚Äôs function. the goal od the appication is to:
- View your 23andme data, and access the NIH database at the same time.
- identify the SNPs which occurs with low frequency in the population, and so the ones _which are characteristic of you_. They very likely reveal your most interesting infromation.

The application currently limits the analysis to the SNPs to the [Y Chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome) (which you likely not have if you are female) and [Mitochondrial DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA), which you share with your sibling ad your mother, and grandmother. This limitation arbitrary simply because I‚Äôm interested in the genealogy, and a display of the full genome will take simmply too long and it is nort practical for being done inn the browser.

### Privacy
Privacy is an important feature when dealing with genomic information. This application is designed to completly respect your privacy. The applicaton **does not** upload, store or retain in any way your genome. Your genome will not leave your browser, and so your computer. The application however does leverage Google's Analytics to track the number of page access.
